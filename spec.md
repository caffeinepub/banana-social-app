# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the logo graphic from the Navigation component.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove any logo image or custom graphic (e.g., Om symbol) from the Navigation component
- Replace with plain text branding or remove entirely, keeping Feed and Profile links intact

**User-visible outcome:** The navigation bar displays no logo image or graphic, only text and navigation links, with no broken image errors.
