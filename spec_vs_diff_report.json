  "summary": "The implementation covers all five requirements broadly well. The backend Motoko actor implements all required entities and methods. The frontend builds a feed page, compose post UI, profile page, and banana-themed navigation. However, there are a few notable gaps: stable variables are not confirmed in the truncated backend code, and the backend data model uses mutable Maps (let) without explicit stable variable declarations visible in the diff. The images required by the build request are referenced but not included as added files (2 files omitted due to limits, likely the images). Overall coverage is strong.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "All state is persisted in stable variables",
      "reason": "The backend code uses `let users = Map.empty<UserId, User>()` and similar declarations without the `stable` keyword visible in the shown portion. The diff is truncated so stable variable declarations may exist later, but there is no evidence of stable variable usage for persistence in the visible code.",
